# 📊 Matplotlib Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Matplotlib Learning Repository**!  
This repository contains everything I’ve learned while exploring Python’s powerful `matplotlib` library for data visualization. All the code and visualizations were created and tested in **Google Colab**.

## 📚 What I Learned

### ✅ Getting Started
- How to install and import the `matplotlib.pyplot` module
- Using `numpy` to generate numerical data for plotting

### 📈 Graph Plotting
- Plotting basic **line graphs**
- Visualizing **sine** and **cosine** waves using NumPy
- Plotting a **parabola** to understand quadratic curves
- Adding **titles**, **x-axis**, and **y-axis** labels for clarity

### 📊 Data Visualization Types
- Creating **bar plots** to represent categorical data
- Plotting **multiple graphs together** on the same axes
- Designing **pie charts** with labels and percentages
- Generating **scatter plots** to show relationships between two datasets

### 🧭 3D Plotting
- Creating **3D scatter plots** using `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` for visualizing data in three dimensions

## 💻 Platform

All the visualizations were developed and tested using **Google Colab**, which provides an interactive and cloud-based Python environment with all essential libraries pre-installed.

Since these were personal learning notebooks, **no direct Colab links are included** in this repository.  
However, if you want to try similar code yourself:

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Start a new notebook
3. Paste the code snippets from this repository
4. Run the cells and experiment freely!

## 🎥 Source of Learning

I learned these concepts from the YouTube channel **[Siddhardhan]**.  
His explanations and step-by-step tutorials made learning `matplotlib` simple and enjoyable.
